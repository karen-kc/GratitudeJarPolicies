<h1>Gratitude Jar – Privacy Policy</h1>

<h3>Overview</h3>

This Privacy Policy describes the information collected by Karen Chan ("us", "we", or "our") through our mobile application (the "Application") and how we use that information.

<h3>Information Collection and Use</h3>

<h4>Types of Data Collected</h4>

(1) We do not collect or store any Personal Data. 

We do not have a sign-in process in which users must provide Personally Identifiable Information. User Generated Content remains on their device, unless the user has chosen to use an internal backup solution (e.g. iPhone users may enable iCloud backups). We do not have any access to the users’ devices or their internal backup solutions. 

(2) We do not collect or store any other Usage Data. 

(3) We obtain your email address when you request support via email or customer support contact form. We use your email only to contact you to provide support or feedback.

Our Application works in offline mode, unless the user enables phone backups such as iCloud, all user entries stay offline as well.

<h4>Mode and Place of Processing the Data</h4>

We do not have Personal Data to process. We have not taken any measures that would enable us to access user data through our Application. We do not have a server or a database on which Data is stored. 

We cannot restore any data the user might lose (e.g. by losing their phone, because we do not have that data to begin with). 

<h2>Changes To This Privacy Policy</h2>

You are advised to review this Privacy Policy periodically for any changes. Changes to this Privacy Policy are effective when they are posted on this page.
