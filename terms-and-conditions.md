
<h1>Gratitude Jar - Terms & Conditions</h1>

<h3>General</h3>

These Terms and Conditions govern, together with the Privacy Policy, your use of the Gratitude Jar mobile application (the ”Application”) provided by Karen Chan ("us", "we", or "our").

By downloading or using the Application, you agree to be bound by these Terms and Conditions, you confirm and affirm that you have read, understood and agree to 
these Terms and Conditions. 

You should be aware that there are certain things that we will not take responsibility for. Certain functions of the Application will require the Application 
to have an active internet connection. The connection can be Wi-Fi, or provided by your mobile network provider, but we cannot take responsibility
for the Application not working at full functionality if you do not have access to Wi-Fi, and you do not have any of your data allowance left.

If you are using the Application outside of an area with Wi-Fi, you should remember that your terms of the agreement with your mobile network provider will 
still apply. As a result, you may be charged by your mobile provider for the cost of data for the duration of the connection while accessing the Application, 
or other third-party charges. In using the Application, you are accepting responsibility for any such charges, including roaming data charges if you use the Application outside of your home territory (i.e. region or country) without turning off data roaming. If you are not the bill payer for the device on which you are using the Application, please be aware that we assume that you have received permission from the bill payer for using the Application.

Along the same lines, we cannot always take responsibility for the way you use the Application. For example, you need to make sure that your device stays 
charged – if it runs out of battery and you cannot turn it on to avail the Application, we cannot accept responsibility.

With respect to our responsibility for your use of the Application, when you are using the Application, it is important to bear in mind that although we endeavour to ensure that it is updated and correct at all times, we do rely on third parties (including JTAppleCalendar) to provide information to us so that we can make it available to you. We accept no liability for any loss, direct or indirect, you experience as a result of relying wholly on this functionality of the Application.

Our Application allow users to input content (e.g. write journal entries). We neither endorse nor assume any liability for the content you create in our Application. If you share or distribute that content through various means (including but not limited to taking a screenshot of the content and uploading
it on social media), you accept full responsibility for any consequences of both creating and distributing that content. You agree to take full responsibility for the content you upload, post, or share on the Website.

We are committed to ensuring that the Application is as useful and efficient as possible. For that reason, we reserve the right to make changes to the 
Application or to charge for its services, at any time and for any reason. We will never charge you for the Application or its services without making it very clear to you exactly what you are paying for.

At some point, we may wish to update the Application. The Application is currently available on iOS – the requirements for system (and for any additional systems we decide to extend the availability of the Application to) may change, and you will need to download the updates if you want to keep using the Application. We do not promise that it will always update the Application so that it is relevant to you and/or works with the iOS version that you have installed on your device. However, you promise to always accept updates to the Application when offered to you. We may also wish to stop providing the Application, and may terminate use of it at any time without giving notice of termination to you. Unless we tell you otherwise, upon any termination, (a) the rights and licenses granted to you in these terms will end; (b) you must stop using the Application, and (if needed) delete it from your device.

<h3>Disclaimer of Warranty</h3>

The Application and all of its content is provided on an ”As Is” and ”As available” basis and we do not provide any assurances of the availability or usability by you of the Application.

<h3>Limitation of Liability</h3>
